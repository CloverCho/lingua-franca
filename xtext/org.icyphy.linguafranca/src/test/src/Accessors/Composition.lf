/** Composite with three actors from the Accessors library.
 *  When compiled by a Lingua Franca compiler, this file produces one, a test
 *  that may be executed as follows:
 *  <pre>
 *     node ACCESSORS/web/hosts/node/nodeHostInvoke.js Composition
 *  </pre>
 *  Here, ACCESSORS is the location on your filesystem of the accessors repo
 *  (see http://accessors.org).  For example, if you have installed Ptolemy II and
 *  set the PTII variable to the root of Ptolemy II, then the following will work:
 *  <pre>
 *     node $PTII/org/terraswarm/accessor/accessors/web/hosts/node/nodeHostInvoke.js Composition
 *  </pre>
 *  The test passes if no exception is thrown. It should print something like
 *  "All initialized accessors have wrapped up. Terminating."
