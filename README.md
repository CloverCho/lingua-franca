# Lingua Franca

See the main [wiki](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki) for documentation.

Lingua Franca (LF) is a polyglot Interface Definition Language (IDL) for the defintion and composition of [reactors](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/reactors). The output of the LF compiler is target code that references a runtime library that coordinates the ensemble in accordance with the [reactor semantics](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/wiki/Semantics).
