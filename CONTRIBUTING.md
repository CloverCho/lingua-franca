# Contributing to LF

### Setup

If you plan to contribute to Lingua Franca, we recommend following the [Developer Eclipse setup with Oomph](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/wiki/Developer-Eclipse-Setup-with-Oomph) instructions. Otherwise, you can download a release.

In addition, if you want a Kotlin-friendly developer environment using IntelliJ, you can also follow the [Developer IntelliJ Setup (for Kotlin)](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/wiki/Developer-IntelliJ-Setup-%28for-Kotlin%29) instructions to set it up.

You can also build and run the Lingua Franca IDE without the Eclipse setup. To run Lingua Franca IDE (Epoch) with Kotlin-based code generators enabled (which is not possible with the Eclipse setup), please see the instructions in [Running Lingua Franca IDE (Epoch) with Kotlin based Code Generators Enabled (without Eclipse Environment)](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/wiki/Running-Lingua-Franca-IDE-%28Epoch%29-with-Kotlin-based-Code-Generators-Enabled-%28without-Eclipse-Environment%29).

### Github workflow

* Develop new changes in a separate topic branch, in a fork if you're not part of the main LF organisation.
* Every change needs to go through a PR and get an approving review before it is merged. Pushing to master is restricted.
* All code review is conducted using the Github review system on PRs.
