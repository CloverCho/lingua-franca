/**
 * Model of a smart intersection with a road-side unit (RSU)
 * that regulates the flow of automated vehicles through the
 * intersection. Vehicles that are approaching the intersection
 * send an initial message to the RSU with their speed and
 * distance to the intersection. The RSU responds with a
 * reservation for when the vehicle can enter the intersection
 * and what its average speed through the intersection should be.
 * 
 * This is meant as a supervisory controller, and it assumes that
 * the vehicle is equipped with a low-level controller (or a human)
 * that is responsible for lane keeping, collision avoidance, etc.
 * 
 * This is a very rough starting point that needs a lot of work.
 * 
 * Note: the vehicle control relies on an external vehicle interface
 *  that provides 'vehicle_status' and a 'vehicle_position' (see the
 *  preamble below). Without these inputs, this application will not
 *  do anything when executed.
