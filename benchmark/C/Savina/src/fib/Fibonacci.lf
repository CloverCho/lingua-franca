/** Fibonacci Benchmark from the Savina Suite:
* Measures the speed of message passing between reactors:
* Reactors send either requests or responses: a Request can be met with another request, 
* or a request can be met with an response.  These messages are passed back and forth until the 
* requested Fibonacci number is found
