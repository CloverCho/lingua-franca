/**
 * Simple demonstration of asynchronous input and timed output.
 * This program opens a simple, terminal-based user interface for
 * specifying a rhythmic audio output. The rhythm is displayed in
 * the terminal as it is generated and produced as audio using
 * the terminal's "beep" functionality. Note that not all terminal
 * implementation provide audio output, so you may not hear any
 * audible beeps. Moreover, many terminal implementations implement
 * the beep in such a way that it occupies a fixed amount of time
 * that may be longer than the 'sixteenth' parameter given here,
 * in which case the audible rhythm will not be accurate.
 * Regrettably, this "beep" functionality is the closest we have
 * been able to find to any sort of even remotely portable audio
 * output.
 * 
 * This program uses ncurses, which needs to be installed on your machine
 * for this to work. It also uses the library utility sensor_simulator,
 * provided with Lingua Franca, which uses keyboard input to simulate
 * asynchronous sensors and beeps to simulate timed output.
 * See lingua-franca/lib/C/sensor_simulator.h.
 * 
 * You can construct simple rhythms with this program.
 * The sixteenth parameter determines the duration of a sixteenth note,
 * the finest resolution this example supports.
 * You can turn on and off several beeps to occur within the bar
 * with keyboard input.
